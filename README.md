# workshop-git

A workshop space for learning Git, with sample folders in different branches.


## branches

### [divide/biggie](https://github.com/escudero89/workshop-git/tree/divide/biggie)

The idea here is to create two new branches, `divide/first` and `divide/second`,
splitting the work done in two and erasing this big branch.
